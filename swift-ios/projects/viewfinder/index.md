## Iterations

Iteration 1: UI
https://github.com/turingschool-projects/kwk-level3-swift/blob/master/sessions/viewfinder_ui_lab.markdown
- provide screenshot/giphy of everything they should have at the end.

Iteration 2: Camera & Photos
https://github.com/turingschool-projects/kwk-level3-swift/blob/master/sessions/implement_camera_display_photos_lab.markdown (uses instance language; change. also references old slide decks, update links)
- provide screenshot/giphy of everything they should have at the end.

Iteration 3: Core Data
https://github.com/turingschool-projects/kwk-level3-swift/blob/master/sessions/core_data_lab.markdown
- bullet point #2 - real shitty direction, fix.
- lots of shitty directions in first section.
- ??Should first section actually go into iteration 1 - UI setup??? I think so.

- never explains how to do this: "create an instance of the Core Data Object (I called my Photo; yours may be something else, so keep that in mind while you are going through this!)", so super confusing
- provide screenshot/giphy of everything they should have at the end.


Iteration 4: Photo Detail View
https://github.com/turingschool-projects/kwk-level3-swift/blob/master/sessions/build_photo_detail_view.markdown
- directions are decent.
- provide screenshot/giphy of everything they should have at the end.

Iteration 5: Delete Functionality
https://github.com/turingschool-projects/kwk-level3-swift/blob/master/sessions/delete_functionality_lab.markdown
- dir
- provide screenshot/giphy of everything they should have at the end.
ections are decent.
