## Iterations

Iteration 0: UI
<p class="to-do">provide screenshot/giphy of everything they should have at the end.</p>

Iteration 1: Camera & Photos
<p class="to-do">provide screenshot/giphy of everything they should have at the end.</p>



Iteration 2: Core Data
- bullet point #2 - real shitty direction, fix.
- lots of shitty directions in first section.
- ??Should first section actually go into iteration 1 - UI setup??? I think so.

- never explains how to do this: "create an instance of the Core Data Object (I called my Photo; yours may be something else, so keep that in mind while you are going through this!)", so super confusing
- provide screenshot/giphy of everything they should have at the end.


Iteration 3: Photo Detail View

- provide screenshot/giphy of everything they should have at the end.

Iteration 4: Delete Functionality
https://github.com/turingschool-projects/kwk-level3-swift/blob/master/sessions/delete_functionality_lab.markdown
- dir
- provide screenshot/giphy of everything they should have at the end.
ections are decent.
