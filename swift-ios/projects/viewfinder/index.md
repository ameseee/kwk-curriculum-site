- Implement Delete functionality of a row and Core Data record

## Introduction

What's an iOS app without photos? We see Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook use photos constantly, and they wouldn't be the same (or maybe exist) without user photos.

You are going to build an app that replicates a lot of Instagram's functionality. A user will be able to take a photo (from camera or library), and store it with a caption. The user can see all their photos in a list, and go back to see any specific photo in detail.

Because we have several views, it's important you follow the directions to set up navigation correctly, but outside of that, you have full control over the UI of your app!

Here's a simple version of what you're shooting for:
