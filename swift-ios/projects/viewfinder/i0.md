# ViewFinder: Iteration 0

## Learning Goals

* Students will implement their wireframes into a UI
* Students will create navigation controllers and segues

## Plan

In this lab, you will bring your wireframes to life!

### Getting Started

* On your laptop, find the Xcode application by typing `cmd + space`, typing in `xcode`, then press return
* Click `Create a new Xcode project`
* Under `Choose a template for your new project`, select `iOS`
* Under `Application`, select `Single View App`
* Click the blue `Next` button in the bottom right corner
* ‚ùóÔ∏èYou must check the `Use Core Data` box!‚ùóÔ∏è
* You will be prompted to save this file. For `Product Name`, type in "whatever name your want to officially title your app", then click the blue `Create` button in the bottom right corner
* **NOTE:** This will be your ACTUAL project! From now on, you won't really be creating new projects, just opening this one up and working from wherever you left off.
* In your terminal, navigate to the directory. Run `git init` to initialize a local Git repository. Then run `git add .` and `git commit -m "Initial commit"` to save this starting place in your Git history.

### Build Your ViewFinder UI

Similar to our StoryBoard and Actions/Outlets lessons, we will need to start with the UI, then fill in the details as we go. So this iteration is focused on getting your UI set up!

* Delete the `ViewController` from the StoryBoard scene
* Delete the `ViewController.swift` file from the Navigation Pane (move to trash)
* On the StoryBoard, drag on a `TableViewController` from the Object Library
* With the `TableViewController` selected, click Editor (top nav bar) ‚û° Embed In ‚û° Navigation Controller
  - This will embed the view inside of a Navigation Controller, which will allow us to use a back button, and other similar buttons on the top of the page
* With the Navigation Controller selected, in the Utilities Pane, select the Attributes Inspector, scroll down to the View Controller section, and check the box next to `Is Initial View Controller`

* In the Document Outline, click on the Navigation Item (under `TableViewController`). Now, look at the Attributes Inspector in the Utilities Pane, and you should see a form for Title. Write the name of your app into that field.

* Drag a `Bar Button Item` from the Object Library onto the right-side of your Navigation Bar on the Table View. This will be the button the user taps to visit the "Add New Photo" page. In the Utilities Pane, you can change the title under `Bar Item`. You can also use the drop-down menu title `System Item` to select an iOS icon.

* Drag a new `View Controller` onto your StoryBoard. `ctrl + click` then drag your `Add` button on the Table View over to your new View Controller. Select `show`. This is telling the computer, "when the user clicks on this `add` button, take them to this other view, please." This is called a `segue`.

* The default `back button` will show the entire app name - feel free to change that to "back" or leave as is. You change it by clicking on the home page title, then filling in the `back button` form in the Utilities Pane.

* Drag a `Navigation Item` onto the new ViewController. Change the title in the Utilities Pane to something like "Add New Photo".

> üõë Run on your iPad to make sure it's building

* Add buttons for Camera, PhotoLibrary, and Albums (if all of those are in your wireframes!)
* Add in your `ImageView`, `TextField` for caption, and `Save` button. Apply constraints so it looks good on all devices.
* Insert a placeholder image in the ImageView.

### Commit Your Work

In your terminal, make sure you are still in the viewfinder directory. Add and commit your changes. Your commit message should be something like "Complete Iteration 0".

#### Extension

* In your original wireframes, did you and your partner plan to have a home screen? You can add in another ViewController and change the segues. Test it out on your simulator or iPad to make 100% it's behaving the way you want it to.
* Fill in the blanks from your wireframe - add in colors, fonts, background images, etc. that make this the app you and your partner are dreaming of üí´
