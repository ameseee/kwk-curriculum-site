title: ToDo List
---

## Learning Goals

- Build a project using everything learned up until now - StoryBoards, Actions/Outlets, Camera, Segues, _and_ Core Data
- Implement Delete functionality of a Core Data record

## Introduction

A To-Do List app includes the fundamental components of almost every app:
- The user can add something to a list
- The user can see all items on the list
- The user can delete something from the list

We will build a simple, yet powerful, To-Do list that you can actually use on your iOS device! The tutorial will walk you through making a very simple UI; you can add as much flavor to it as you'd like!

Here's the simple version of what you're shooting for:

## Iterations

- [Iteration 0: Static To-Dos]({{ site.url }}/swift-ios/projects/to-do-list/i0)
- [Iteration 1: Dynamic To-Dos]({{ site.url }}/swift-ios/projects/to-do-list/i1)
- [Iteration 2: Add & Delete with Core Data]({{ site.url }}/swift-ios/projects/to-do-list/i2)
