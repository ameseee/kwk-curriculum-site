title: Mobile Personal Project
---

During the last three days of camp, you will have the opportunity to work on a personal project - topic of your choice - and present it at Demo Day!

## Project Pitches

At a specified time, the class will come together to discuss projects pitches, or ideas for personal projects.

As you brainstorm project ideas, think about:
- what all does your app do?
- what problem does it solve?
- who is the audience?
- what technology will you use?
- are there any parts of the technology you don't quite yet know how to implement?

Also, keep in mind that you'll have 2.5-3 days to work on it.

## Project Plan and MVP

Once your project has been approved by your instructors, you need to create a project plan and MVP.

- `MVP` - minimum viable product. You probably have some amazing ideas that will probably change the world, but they may not get all the way there during this 3-day project, and that's ok. MVP is the idea of building part of your app so it's working app, even it doesn't meet all of your goals. Think of chicken - would you want to eat it half cooked? or would you choose to eat half a serving (fully cooked)?
- `Project Plan` - you should map out the steps you need to take to complete your project, starting with wireframes. Also, estimate the amount of time it will take so you can have an idea of where you should be at the end of each work day.

✅ Get your MVP and Project Plan approved by your instructors.

## Wireframes

Make sure you have a **crystal clear** vision for your app. You should wireframe out each screen the user will see, indicate where actions/outlets will be, as well as the names you will use for them. This will make your workflow so much smoother when it's time to implement these wireframes.

✅ Get your wireframes approved by your instructors.

## Daily Stand-Ups

As you work on a bigger project, it becomes more important to check in with your team on a regular basis. Whether you are a 1-person or 3-person team, you'll be checking in with your instructor daily (and on Thursday, twice) to make sure you are on track and get any support you need.

## Demo Day

On Friday afternoon, you will give a live demo of your app to the KWK community - your fellow scholars, instructors, mentors and families! We will have a couple sessions to help you prepare an practice a presentation; there is nothing to do now on this, we just wanted to give you a heads up.
