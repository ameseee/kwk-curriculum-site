This is a one-day Swift project for the first week of KWK Level 3 Swift/iOS camp.

## Learning Goals

* Use basic data types and control-flow instructions in Swift
* Use Xcode to write and execute code
* Apply problem-solving skills to design and implement code
* Debug a complex program

## Introduction

Let's imagine that we're pilots setting off to fly cross-country. Maybe you decide to take the Kode With Klossy tour and will visit every city where KWK camps are happening. Let's build a tool to help plan our routes and keep track of things like travel time and fuel consumption.

## Process & Theory

We'll build the project in several iterations. The goal is that each iteration starts with a working project and ends with a working project. The most important thing is to practice doing things *right*. It's better to build fewer iterations and have them work correctly then to try building everything but have a pile of junk.

## Iterations

Today we'll build the project in several parts:

* [I0: Up and Running]()
* [I1: Destinations]()
* [I2: Distance and Fuel]()
