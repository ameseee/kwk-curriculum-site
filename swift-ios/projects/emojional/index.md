title: Emojional
---

## Learning Goals

- Wireframe & build a UI that looks great on all device sizes
- Implement alerts in an iOS application
- Write code to have randomly generated messages appear for user

## Introduction

We all get emotional, all the time. Sometimes we need a friend to give a word of encouragement, no matter what kind of emotion we are dealing with.

You are going to build an app that allows a user to tap an emoji that represents how they feel, then get a message to encourage them! The messages will be specific based on the emoji they selected.

You have full control over the UI of this app (it is truly a single screen), the emojis you pick, how many emojis the user can pick from, and the messages you provide to your user!

Here's a super plain version of what you're shooting for:

## Iterations

Today we'll build the project in several parts:

* [I0: Build UI & Setup]({{ site.url }}/swift-ios/projects/emojional/i0)
* [I1: Alert]({{ site.url }}/swift-ios/projects/emojional/i1)
* [I2: Custom Messages]({{ site.url }}/swift-ios/projects/emojional/i2)
* [I3: Ramdonize Messages]({{ site.url }}/swift-ios/projects/emojional/i3)
