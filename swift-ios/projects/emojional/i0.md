# Iteration 0: Build UI

## Iteration Goals

By the end of this iteration, your app should:
  - have at least two buttons, each with an emoji
  - be completely styled (including constraints and home screen icon)

## Build Your UI

Design the UI of you app on a wireframe page:
  * Decide which emojis you want to display for your user to pick from.
  * Decide on a color scheme (if you want the background of your buttons to have a color).
  * For now, this should _just be_ this a single-view app. When you have a working product, you can commit and push to GitHub, then decide if you have time if you have an idea for another screen.
  * Get your wireframe approved by an instructor.

Create a new Xcode project. You do NOT need Core Data.

Make your wireframes come to life on your StoryBoard. Do **not** establish any outlets or actions yet.

## Commit Your Changes

Run in simulator one last time to make sure everything looks just the way you want it to!

In your terminal, make sure you are still in the emojional directory. Add and commit your changes. Your commit message should be something like "Complete Iteration 0".

You're ready to go on to [Iteration 1]({{ site.url }}/swift-ios/projects/emojional/i1)!
