title: Segues
---

## Learning Goals

* Understand why segues are a building block for iOS development
* Build segues between views
* Practice reading a blog post to learn a new skill

## Technical Vocabulary

- Segues
- View Controllers

## How Many Views in an App?

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Check It Out: Different Views</h2>
  <p>With your partner, pick a driver and a note-taker. The driver will tap around as much as possible on an iOS app. The note-taker will tally every time the app showed a completely different view. You will have exactly one minute.</p>
  <h3>Reflect</h3>
  <p>How many different views did you encounter? What was the transition like between views? What would your experience as a user be like if the whole app was on one single view?</p>
</div>

## Segues

Those transitions - from view to view - are called **segues**. We also want to be able to show the user a different view when they click a button. For a good user experience, that segue should provide a smooth animation so it's easy on the eyes, and feels natural.

## Learn from other Developers

You will shortly read through a blog post to learn how to implement segues. On the first read through, please _only_ read and take notes. The reason for this is: sometimes the title of a blog won't give the most accurate information, and halfway through reading it, a software developer realizes it's not the thing they were looking for. The first read allows you to make sure this is the right thing, and that we have the tools/knowledge to start at this point (sometimes we need to learn some of the stepping stones first). Please do this independently!

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Turn & Talk: First Read Debrief</h2>
  <p>From your first read through the blog:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Any words/terms you don't understand?</li>
    <li>Do you feel like you have the tools to follow along in Xcode next time you read it?</li>
    <li>In your own words, what is a segue?</li>
    <li>List the basic steps (don't need details) of how to create a segue.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Now that we know this blog gives us the info we want and is on our level, we can go through the tutorial to practice! Open up a new Xcode project and follow along!

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Class Discussion: Second Read Debrief</h2>
  <p>From your first read through the blog:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What challenges came up in completing this?</li>
    <li>Did reading it one time through first seem to help? Why or why not?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is what software developers do <strong>every day</strong>! And you just did it! Being pushed out of your comfort zone is essential in learning, so if it felt challenging at times, that is ok and actually good!</p>
