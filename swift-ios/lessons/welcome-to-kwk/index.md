We are so excited to welcome you to the Kode With Klossy community. With over 1000 alumni and nearly 1000 scholars this summer, this is a powerful group of young women across the country.

## Your Instructors

As a class, you'll spend some time getting to know your Instructors and TAs.

## What we will build this summer

As a participant in the 2019 Mobile camp, you will learn the fundamentals of iOS development. iOS developers work on the part of the app that users see and interact with. They build out the elements we see on the screen, style them so they look clean and professional, and write code to make the page _do_ something. iOS developers do _not_ deal with data like logging users in and storing information (that work is for back-end developers). There are several ways that iOS apps can be built, we will use Swift (Apple''s programming language just for iOS apps), and Xcode (a tool where we write Swift code and build out the User Interface).

Using the Swift language and Xcode as a tool to build User Interfaces, we will be able to build beautiful iOS app that can respond to user interaction!

During the last few days of camp, you'll be able to brainstorm and design a project that you are passionate about building, using all the skills you have at that point! Here are a couple videos of apps that scholars made last year:
