* action

## Creating Objects with Classes

Up until now, we've only written classes to the extent that we can print details about an object created from those classes. When we build more complex programs, we typically have many classes, and the objects from those classes interact in some way.

Let's look at an example, step by step. Today we will be talking about items in a pantry, with <a target="blank" href="http://aperiodictableblog.com/?p=4529">The Perfect 10</a> in mind üç™üíó

With your partner:
- Explain what is happening on each line of the following code snippet
- Predict what will print to the console for the three print statements at the bottom

```swift
// Pantry.swift

class Pantry {

  var walkIn = false
  var temperature = 0

  init(pantryWalkIn : Bool, pantryTemp : Int) {
    walkIn = pantryWalkIn
    temperature = pantryTemp
  }

}
```

```swift
// main.swift

var pantry = Pantry(pantryWalkIn: true, pantryTemp: 62)

print(pantry.walkIn)
print(pantry.temperature)
```

As of now, our pantry can't **do** much, it just sits there once it's created with its properties. Let's a property where the Pantry can store foods (let's call it contents), then an action that lets the Pantry add new foods to it.

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Turn & Talk</h2>
  <p>What data type should our <code class="try-it-code">contents</code> property be? (String, Integer, Array, Dictionary, etc.) Explain your reasoning.</p>
</div>

### Update Pantry

Let's update our pantry with that contents property:

```swift
class Pantry {

  var walkIn = false
  var temperature = 0
  var contents = [String]()

  init(pantryWalkIn : Bool, pantryTemp : Int) {
    walkIn = pantryWalkIn
    temperature = pantryTemp
  }

}
```

Since we are starting with an empty array, we know that at some point we are going to add things to it. Think back to our Arrays lesson, we learned about the `append` method. For our pantry action, it might look like this:

```swift
func addFood(food : String) {
  contents.append(food)
}
```

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Add contents to Pantry</h2>
  <p>Write a Pantry class in Xcode, create an object from it, and write several print statements to see what data is stored in your properties. Then, call <code class="try-it-code">pantry.addFood("your favorite food")</code>, and then another print statement for <code class="try-it-code">pantry.contents</code>. Do you have <code class="try-it-code">your favorite food</code> in your pantry now?</p>
  <p>Check in with your partner and make sure you both have this working.</p>
</div>

## Build a Second Class

We have a bit going on with our pantry, but no interaction yet. Let's make a food class, then we'll come back and edit our pantry.

```swift
class Food {

  var name = ""
  var calories = 0

  init(foodName : String, numberCalories : Int) {
    name = foodName
    calories = numberCalories
  }

}
```

## Object Interaction

Now that we have Food objects with a little more information than a string, we can start making our Pantry and Food objects interact. In the `addFood` action on our Pantry class, we will actually create a food object with that string that is passed in. This means we also need to pass in an Int to `addFood` for the calories. Let's update that action:

```swift
func addFood(food : String, calories : Int) {
    var newFood = Food(foodName: food, numberCalories: calories)
    contents.append(newFood)
}
```

Notice that the food object is stored in a variable called `newFood`. On the next line, we are still using the `append` method, this time appending a _food **object**_ instead of the _food string_.

Now that we are passing in a food object instead of a string, we need to update the `contents` property in our Pantry class to hold an array of `Food` objects rather than `Strings`.

```swift
var contents = [Food]()
```

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Loop over Pantry contents</h2>
  <p><strong>First</strong>, update your Pantry and Food classes to reflect what we've talked about, then add the following to your <code class="try-it-code">main.swift</code> file:</p>
  <code class="try-it-code">var pantry = Pantry(pantryWalkIn: true, pantryTemp: 62)</code>
  <br><br>
  <code class="try-it-code">print(pantry.foods)</code>
  <br><br>
  <code class="try-it-code">pantry.addFood(food: "almond flour", calories: 100)</code>
  <br>
  <code class="try-it-code">pantry.addFood(food: "gluten-free oats", calories: 230)</code>
  <br>
  <code class="try-it-code">pantry.addFood(food: "mini chocolate chips", calories: 90)</code>
  <br><br>
  <code class="try-it-code">print(pantry.foods)</code>
  <br><br>
  <p>What you see printed out probably looks something like: <code class="try-it-code">[]</code> <code class="try-it-code">[object_interaction.Food, object_interaction.Food, object_interaction.Food]</code>. Notice there are three elements in this array, which seems to match the three times <code class="try-it-code">addFood</code> was called, but I want more info about each element.</p>
  <p><strong>Second</strong>, write a <code class="try-it-code">for-in</code> loop to print out the name and calories of each food in the pantry.</p>
</div>

## Object Interaction

There are many ways objects can interact; we will mainly work with code that looks like what we did with the pantry and foods today.

To recap:
- We wrote two classes that had a relationship (a pantry has a collection of foods)
- We wrote an action on the pantry that adds foods
- The action takes in any arguments that are required to create a food, then creates a food object, then appends that food object to the pantry's `contents` property.

<div class="practice">
  <h2>Practice: Object Interaction</h2>
  <h3>Scholars and Camps</h3>
  <p>Your job is to build a Scholar class and a Camp class. You can choose what properties each class has on it. The Camp class should have an <code class="try-it-code">addCamper</code> action on it, which creates a Scholar object and stores that in a list of all the campers.</p>
  <h3>Extension: Camps and KWK</h3>
  <p>Build a KWK class that creates and stores camps. The KWK class should have a year property. Make sure your camp has a location and title (WebDev or Mobile).</p>
