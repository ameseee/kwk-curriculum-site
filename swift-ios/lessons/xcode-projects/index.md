## Xcode Projects

Up until now, we've mainly worked in Xcode Playgrounds, which are a great place to run code, but we can't build real iOS apps in it. Xcode _Projects_ is a place where we can! A lot more than writing code goes into building an iOS app, but we do it all in Xcode. It is a big program with a lot of tools; we will take it one step at a time. [Here's]({{ site.url }}/swift-ios/lessons/storyboard/assets/xcode-map.png) a map of the main features in Xcode.

Either watch the video below, or watch your instructor walk through how to navigate an Xcode Project.

Before watching it, make sure you open up an Xcode Project so you can follow along.
