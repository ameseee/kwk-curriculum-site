## Classes & Objects

When we work with classes, we think about our code in terms of objects. A **class** is like a blueprint, or a cookie cutter for our code. It is a chunk of code, usually in it's own file, that can hold data and functions. It kind of serves as a factory - think about a car factory - they have a blueprint, then make thousands of cars from that blueprint. The cars from this blueprint will have a lot in common, but each may have it's own differences - colors, fabric for seats, etc.

An **object** is created from a class, or cookie cutter. Thinking back to that car factory: the class is the blueprint, the object is the actual car that gets built. Our objects won't be _physical_ objects, but they will be created from our class blueprint, so have some things in common, but can have their own flavor, like an actual car can have a different color.

Together, we are going to make a scholar class. It will be a blueprint for a scholar, then we will make individual scholar object using that blueprint.

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Turn & Talk</h2>
  <p>With your partner, make a list of things that all scholars have - they don't have all to be the same. The first thing on the list might be "name".</p>
</div>

### Scholar Class

We are about to write a Scholar class, but first, here are a few things you may want to know about classes:
* start with keyword `class`, lowercased
* class name is next, 1st letter capitalized
* open code block with curly brackets

```swift
class Scholar {
  // code will go here
}

// calling Scholar() creates an object from the Scholar class:
var newScholar = Scholar()
print(newScholar)
```

The code above isn't much, but it is a class! When this file runs, we will see something like `__lldb_expr_3.Scholar` print out, which looks funky, but what matters most is the ending of `.Scholar`. This tells us that the value of the `Scholar` variable was created from the Scholar class.

Let's add some **properties** to our class:

```swift
class Scholar {
  var grade = 10
  var studying = "Swift"
  var name = "Ophelia"
}

var newScholar = Scholar()
print(newScholar)
```

A **property** is a piece of information that we want to attach to each object made from a class. Right now, every scholar object we create with the Scholar class will be labeled as in grade 10, studying Swift, and named Ophelia.

To illustrate this, we can add some print statements using the dot notation:

```swift
print(newScholar)
//-> __lldb_expr_3.Scholar
print(newScholar.grade)
//-> 10
print(newScholar.studying)
//-> Swift
print(newScholar.name)
//-> Ophelia
```

It's safe to say all scholars in _this camp_ are studying Swift, but it's unlikely that every scholar is in grade 10, and extremely unlikely that everyone has the same name.

Luckily, Swift gives us a way to personalize each object when it's created. It will look similar to the way we pass arguments to functions. We will do with with an **initializer**.

## Initializer

The initializer is a special function inside of a class. `init` is a keyword; if you write a function called `init` inside of a class, it will be called when you create an object from that class. One difference is that we _don't_ use the `func` keyword before `init`.

`init` runs once and only once: when we create a new object from the class. It is written inside the class, below any property variables we declare for that class. It can take arguments, which can help make our class dynamic. In this case, that means giving each scholar their own name.

Let's add this `init` function into our class, giving it an argument of `scholarName`, which is a string.

```swift
class Scholar {

  var grade = 10
  var studying = "Swift"
  var name = ""     // default this to an empty string!

  init(scholarName : String) {
    name = scholarName
  }

}
```

Inside of init, we've re-assigned `name` to whatever `scholarName` was passed in as. This won't work quite yet, because when we call `Scholar()`, we are not passing it a `scholarName` argument like it expects. Let's pass it Scholar(scholarName : "Viola") and re-run.

```swift
var newScholar = Scholar(scholarName : "Viola")

print(newScholar)
//-> __lldb_expr_1.Scholar

print(newScholar.name)
//-> Viola
```

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Initializer and Arguments</h2>
  <p>If you didn't code along, get up-to-date on what we have for the scholar class. Then, add another argument and re-assignment in <code class="try-it-code">init</code> for the <code class="try-it-code">gradeLevel</code> so that we can have scholars in different grades!</p>
</div>

## Actions

Classes can have properties AND actions! **Actions** are functions that are associated with a class. Like `init`, they are written inside the `{}` curly braces of the declared class. This means that every object created from a class, will have **access** to this function. Let's write one so we can see it in action.

Here's an example, building on our Scholar class:

```swift
class Scholar {

  var studying = "Swift"
  var name = ""
  var grade = 0

  init(scholarName : String, scholarGrade: Int) {
    name = scholarName
    grade = scholarGrade
  }

  func writeCode() {
    print("\(name) is busy writing code!")
  }

}
```

Now we can check that is it working by calling the method on the object. This looks a lot like the syntax when we call on properties, but we need to **call** the function using the `()`.

```swift
var newScholar = Scholar(scholarName: "Amy", scholarGrade : 11)

newScholar.writeCode()
//-> "Amy is busy writing code!"
```

`writeCode()` is a function, but more specifically an **action** for this class, and this class only. You can even try calling it in the file without the newScholarpreceding it, and see an error!

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Actions</h2>
  <p>Update your code so that you have the <code class="try-it-code">writeCode</code> action. Then, add another method of your choice to the scholar class! Call the action on an object to make sure it's working as expected.</p>
</div>

Just to be clear, actions written inside a class can **only** be called on objects created from that class. If you try to call it like a normal function, you'll run into problems.

```swift
var newScholar = Scholar(scholarName: "Amy", scholarGrade : 11)

newScholar.writeCode()
//-> "Amy is busy writing code!"

writeCode()
//-> ERROR
```

## Classes vs. Objects

Classes are the blueprints or cookie cutters. Objects are created from the class - in many cases we will pass an argument in to create a class that changes its properties. There can be MANY objects that are created from just one class!

Typically, because classes get big and we usually have many of them, we will see classes written in their own files. This makes our code easier to navigate and maintain. Let's re-organize the work we did with the `Scholar` class in this way.

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Organize Your Files</h2>
  <p>Go back into your code and create at least 3 more scholar objects using the scholar class.</p>
  <p>Now, to prepare ourselves for the Aviatrix project, we are going to use a different tool to run our code.</p>
  <p>Open up Xcode and follow these directions to start it:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a new Xcode project</li>
    <li>Under Choose a template for your new project, select macOS</li>
    <li>Under Application, select Command Line Tool</li>
    <li>Click the blue Next button in the bottom right corner</li>
    <li>You will be prompted to save this file. For Product Name, type in "ClassesAndObjects", then click the blue Create button in the bottom right corner</li>
    <li>You will see a <code class="try-it-code">main.swift</code> file in the file tree on the far left, inside of the ClassesAndObjects folder. Right click on the folder, select New File, make sure that Swift File is selected, then click Next</li>
    <li>Name the file <code class="try-it-code">TheNameOfYourClass</code>, then click Create</li>
    <li>Inside the <code class="try-it-code">TheNameOfYourClass.swift</code> file, copy and paste your class, nothing else.</li>
    <li>Inside the <code class="try-it-code">main.swift</code> file, copy and paste everything else.</li>
    <li>To run the code, click the play button in the top left corner of the screen.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The exact same thing is happening, but we now have our code organized out into files with a single responsibility.</p>
</div>

Now that we can write classes and use them to create objects, _and_ organize our code like professional developers, let's put it all together with this partner activity.

<div class="practice">
  <h2>Practice: Classes & Objects</h2>
  <h3>Choose Your Own Class</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>With your partner, brainstorm another class. Remember, we used Scholar because all scholars share some things, and also had some unique things about them. If you are struggling for an idea, Car and Dog are both commonly used to practice work with classes üöó üê∂</li>
    <li>With your partner, write a list of properties your class should have. What is true about every ____? (If you are talking about a car, every car has wheels...)</li>
    <li>What function, or action, do you want your _____ to take? (If it's a dog, I would want it to bark, sit, fetch...) Come up with at least 2 actions!</li>
    <li>Write your class in an Xcode MocOS, Terminal Project</li>
    <li>Create variables for the properties your class needs</li>
    <li>Write the actions for your class</li>
    <li>In main.swift, create at least one object with this class and do some printing to make sure your class is behaving as expected</li>
    <li>Add in an `init` function so you can pass your class something specific to the object you are creating. (For a car, I would definitely want to make sure the color could change!)</li>
  </ul>
