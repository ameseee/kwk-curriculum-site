title: Mad Lib Generator
---

Applying what you've learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then pushing yourself to do some problem-solving and research, you are going to build a Mad Libs Generator! If you aren't familiar with "Mad Libs", read up on it <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs">here</a>.

### Must-Haves

- A prompt for the user to provide a noun, verb and adjective
- A button for the user to submit their input
- A response on the screen, telling the user the "Mad Lib" that was generated using their inputs!

### Tips

- One you get the inputs, you'll need to use `string interpolation` with the user inputs and some of your words, as well.
- It's be great if every Mad Lib generated didn't have the exact same sentence structure...ðŸ¤”

### Iterations

You are not being provided with Iterations in order to push you to plan out how you will spend your time. You got this!
