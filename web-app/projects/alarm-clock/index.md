title: Alarm Clock/POM Timer
---

Applying what you've learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then pushing yourself to do some problem-solving and research, you are going to build an alarm clock!

You can decide if it's a countdown timer - set a timer for 30 minutes to study, or a timer that will go off at a certain time.

### Must-Haves

- A way for the user to "set" the alarm
- A current time/time left notification
- An alert when the alarm is up!

### Tips

- If you want this to work even when the user closes out of the application then comes back in, you'll need to use `localStorage`
- You'll most likely need to utilize `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()`.
- If you are planning to have a pause functionality, build the app _without_ that first, then add it on once you have the timer working as you want outside of the pause functionality.

Here's <a target="blank" href="https://turingschool-projects.github.io/study-timer-js/">an example</a>. It is currently counting down in seconds rather than minutes to more easily capture the functionality in this gif:
