title: Star Ratings
---

Applying what you've learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then pushing yourself to do some problem-solving and research, you are going to build a small app that allows a user to rate something with 1-5 stars! You've probably seen this feature on various sites before. While we're building a feature that alone doesn't mean much, the learning from this project could be really helpful in your personal project!

### Must-Haves

- A set of empty stars, by default (or other shape!)
- When the user hovers over a star, that star and all stars to the left of it are filled in
- When the user clicks a star, that star and all starts to the left of it are filled in, even when the mouse leaves the star

### Tips

- You will need to have 2 files in your assets directory - an icon of an empty and filled in star (<a target="blank" href="https://www.flaticon.com/">FlatIcon</a> is a great resource.)
- Instead of using `<img` elements, you will probably want to use `<div>`s and insert the star icons as a background image in CSS.

Here is the star rating feature on Amazon:
