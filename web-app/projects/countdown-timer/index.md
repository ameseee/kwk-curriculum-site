title: Countdown Timer
---

Applying what you've learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then pushing yourself to do some problem-solving and research, you are going to build a countdown timer!

You may have seen these before:
- countdown to graduation
- countdown to a vacation
- countdown to you see your best friend again

### Must-Haves

- An event or big day to count down to
- A fun UI relevant to your event or big day
- A countdown in days (but could go down to the minute and even second!)

### Tips

- You will need to utilize the JavaScript [`Date()` constructor](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_date_methods.asp)
- You will need to utilize JavaScripts [`setInterval()` function](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp)
- You will probably have to do some work with around converting numbers to strings, and vice versa
- You will probably have to [split apart strings](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp)

Here's an example:

## Iteration 1 - Wireframe & Vision

- Decide on the event or big day you will count down to
- Draw out your wireframe/vision for the way your Countdown Timer will look
- Like we did with the Twitter card, label each section with the HTML element that will be used
- Find your inspiration! Store links to images or any text you want to use in a GoogleDoc or as comments in a CodePen. Also, decide on your color palette. [Color Supply](https://colorsupplyyy.com/app) is a great resource for this! <a target="blank" href="https://www.flaticon.com/">FlatIcon</a> is a great, free resource for icons. Make sure you give credit to the artists, if necessary
- Make sure your wireframe and assets are approved by your instructor before moving on

**Notice** that you haven't written any code in CodePen yet. The planning process is extremely important and professional developers spend a lot of time in this phase.

## Iteration 2 - Research and Pseudo-Code

- Psuedocode or whiteboard the JavaScript that will need to be in place to make your timer work.
  - What DOM elements will you need to manipulate?
  - How often will it "tick"?
  - How will you get ahold of today's date to compare it to the date in the future?
  - Hint: The tips above give you some starting points on what to research.
- Play around in a CodePen or with some `console.log()` statements to get familiar with the new tools/technologies you need to complete this project.

## Iteration 3 - Implement JavaScript

- Write the code necessary to get your timer working!

**Note**: Once your event/big day takes place, this site will no longer... have any helpful info. If you ever want to re-set the date, you'll update the date in the CodePen.
