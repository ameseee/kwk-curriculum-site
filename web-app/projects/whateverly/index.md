title: Whateverly Project
---

Your HTML, CSS, and DOM Manipulation skills will come in handy to make this look great, but the focus of this project is to give you an opportunity to use make fetch requests.

### Must-Haves

- At least one fetch request to get data from an API
- The data from API is presented nicely to the user

### Tips

- Research your API: There are a lot of free APIs out there, some still require a key. That's ok, as long as they get it to you ASAP. Some make you wait several days before receiving a key.
- Make sure you can get data from your API before building the whole project. You may want to create a "practice-project" folder, or just in your project, before writing HTML, make a fetch request and make sure you can `console.log()` some data.
