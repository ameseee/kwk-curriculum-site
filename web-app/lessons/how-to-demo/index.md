title: How to Demo Your App
---

As a software developer, you have to develop your skill in how to demo the products you build.  A demo, or demonstration, is a way for you to show your application, your ideas, and your proof of concept! Generally demos are short (5-10 min) and provide your audience a clear idea of what you are building and what technologies you used to create the application.

## Plan and Prepare

While planning what you will say in your demo, plan to include the following:
  * Introduce yourself
  * Share WHY you created your application
  * Share the technologies you used
  * Highlight any challenges that you came across in creating your app
  * Discuss what you want to do in the future
  * Time for questions from the audience

Also, it's ideal that your talking points are on slides, and essential that you show the app itself:
  * Make sure the audience can see your screen
  * Create slides that highlight your talking points
  * Practice connecting to the screen you are presenting on
  * Make sure your audience can see the screen from anywhere in the room

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Planning a Demo</h2>
  <p>With your group, discuss and write down your answers to the planning questions.</p>
  <p>Then, select a Google Slides template you all like, and start making slides that highlight your talking points. Make sure to assign each slide to a group member, and make sure to give equal talking time to everyone!</p>
  <p>Consider how you will show the functionality of your app - will you have up your real site? A giphy recording of it? Who will do the clicking, and who will do the talking? Consider every little detail.</p>
</div>

Now that you've planned a demo, it's time to practice presenting it.
  * You should practice your presentation multiple times.
  * Use a timer when you practice.
  * Be comfortable with the words you are using.

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Planning a Demo</h2>
  <p>With your group, do a run through of the demo (or two).</p>
  <p>If you identify any changes you'd like to make to the flow of the presentation, the content, or anything else, go ahead!</p>
</div>

## Don't Forget: HAVE FUN!

Your audience will be so excited and proud to see the app you built and all you've learned. You should be proud, too.
  * Project your voice so everyone can hear you
  * SMILE!
  * Make eye contact
  * Thank your audience

## Final Demo Practice

Your instructors will schedule 1-2 practice times with you/your group before the final demos.
